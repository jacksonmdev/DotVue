# DotVue: An Opinionated Full-Stack Framework with .NET and Vue.js

This repository offers an opinionated approach to building modern web applications by combining the power of **.NET** on the back-end and **Vue.js** on the front-end. Designed to simplify decision-making, it provides a structured, streamlined setup for developers who want to focus on creating rather than configuring.

## Key Features
- **.NET**: A robust, high-performance back-end for APIs and services.
- **Vue.js**: A reactive, user-friendly front-end framework.
- **Opinionated Setup**: Predefined architecture, tooling, and best practices to reduce development friction.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Ready-to-use configurations for rapid project initiation.

Perfect for teams and individuals seeking a guided, efficient full-stack development experience. ðŸš€
